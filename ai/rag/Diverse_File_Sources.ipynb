            "Buffer Overflow (BoF) vulnerabilities occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, leading to potential overwriting of adjacent memory. This can result in crashes, data corruption, or security exploits, including arbitrary code execution. Various security measures and mitigation techniques have been developed to prevent or mitigate the risk of buffer overflows. We have categorized them into developer-based, OS-based, and compiler-based techniques. By employing a combination of these techniques, systems can be hardened against buffer overflow attacks and other memory corruption vulnerabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Developer-Based Techniques These are techniques that developers can/should use during the design and coding phases to reduce the chances of a buffer overflow:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Input Validation: Always validate input data to ensure it conforms to expected lengths, types, and formats. For example: • A developer should check data lengths before copying them to buffers inside the memory. (e.g.,\n",
            "\n",
            "strlen to ensure the length is within bounds). It is always a good practice to set the size of buffer yourself, and do not let users set the length.\n",
            "\n",
            "• Validate user input (e.g., checking for null-termination or controlling the size of arrays).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Use Safe C Functions: Use safer versions of functions that deal with buffers, which limit the amount of data written to a buffer. It is best practice to replace unsafe C functions like strcpy, strcat, sprintf, scanf, and gets with their safer counterparts such as strncpy, strncat, snprintf, fscanf, and fgets respectively, that allow you to specify buffer sizes. Similarly, in C++, use std::vector or std::string instead of raw arrays for dynamic memory management, which handles resizing and bounds checking. Moreover, while using C’s dynamic memory allocation (e.g., malloc, calloc, realloc, and free) functions, ensure the allocated buffer size is correct, avoid fixed size buffers, and initialize pointers and check for null pointers before dereferencing.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Use of Safe Libraries: Instead of linking your C program with standard C library, you can use libsafe.so, which is a shared library that intercepts and replaces dangerous C functions known to cause buffer overflows. By linking your application with libsafe, it hooks into the program and replaces unsafe functions with safer alternatives. Although it was a useful tool, today’s compilers and libraries offer more integrated and modern security mechanisms.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Use of Safer Programming Languages: Use safer programming languages if you have choice. For example, Rust is a modern systems programming language that enforces memory safety without a garbage collector. Rust’s ownership and borrowing system guarantees that common vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) do not occur.\n",

However, we can switch control to Program’s own code, Library code, or OS code. Jumping to an application’s code is not very useful, and jumping to kernel code is not possible as it is protected. So, we are left with only one option and that is jumping to library code. The return-into-libc attack is a category of attack, where instead of jumping to our injected shellcode on the stack, we jump to some existing library code. So, we can find some function (e.g., system, execve) inside the glibc library, which allows us to run a shell program. The main task to do in such type of attack is to find the address of system() function and the address of the /bin/sh program or the string itself inside the memory.

            "Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) Dear students, we all know that in order to launch a BOF attack, the attacker needs to know the stack address where the return address is saved, as well as the stack address where the malicious code is to be injected. If the location where the rbp register is pointing to in a Function Stack Frame is known to us or if the starting address of buffer is known to us, we can guess the location of the saved return address and thus can craft an input string that will successfully launch the BOF attack. A $100 question is: Do we need to have a fixed location for the start of the function stack frame? and the answer is NO. Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is an operating system based defensive mechanism that protects against memory corruption vulnerabilities using a randomization strategy. ASLR is typically implemented at the operating system level and is supported by all modern operating systems like Linux, Windows, and macOS. Since, it randomizes the base addresses of stack and heap, so it makes the standard BOF attack that we have done quite difficult to perform. Moreover, since it also randomizes the addresses of shared libraries loaded in memory, so it also makes the return-into- libc attack difficult as well. On Linux, one can set the ASLR setting using any of the following two commands by giving it a value of 0 (no randomization, 1 (partial randomization) or 2 (full randomization):\n",

            "Stack Canary Stack canary is a GCC compiler extension that is used to protect the application from BOF attacks by exploiting a function’s return address. It was first introduced in Intel x86 as a patch to GCC compiler version 4.1 (2006). When a program calls a function, the return address is pushed in the FSF, and the stack canary/guard (a random value) is also placed on the stack right after the return address. This canary value is also saved somewhere else in a safer place. When the function returns after execution, the canary value is compared to the actual value. If both values are the same, it means the return address is protected. If a buffer overflow overwrites the canary value, the program detects the modification and terminates before the attack can proceed. The gcc compiler from version 4.9 (2014) onwards provides following levels of stack protection using following flags: • -fstack-protector: Enables basic stack protection, placing a canary value on the stack to detect overflows in functions with local buffers (especially those that might be vulnerable to overflow).\n",

Similarly, the .data and .bss sections from multiple object files are merged, with .data holding initialized data and .bss holding uninitialized data. Moreover, since every .o file has its own symbol table, so if the same symbol (e.g., a function or variable) is defined in multiple object files, the linker must resolve which definition to use. In most cases, the linker uses the first definition it encounters or provides a mechanism to handle multiple definitions. The output of linking phase is an executable file with a specific format (e.g., ELF on Linux, PE on Windows).

This executable can even run on those machines where standard C library doesn’t exist.

            "We all know that a vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the system's integrity, availability, and/or confidentiality. Vulnerabilities can exist in various types of systems and can lead to unintended behaviours or security breaches. The C programming language, while powerful and widely used, has several inherent features and common pitfalls that can lead to vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities often arise due to the low-level nature of C, its handling of memory, and lack of built-in safety mechanisms. Here’s a summary of common vulnerabilities associated with C programming and the reasons behind them:\n",
            "\n",
            "o Buffer Overflow Vulnerability: Occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing adjacent memory locations to be overwritten. C does not automatically check the bounds of arrays or buffers. Functions like strcpy(), sprint(), and gets() can cause buffer overflows if the input data exceeds the allocated size.\n",
            "\n",
            "char buffer[10]; strcpy(buffer, \"This is a very long string\");\n",
            "\n",
            "o Stack Smashing: A specific type of buffer overflow that overwrites the stack, potentially altering the return address. Similar to buffer overflow, but specifically targets the stack area of memory. This can lead to control flow hijacking.\n",
            "\n",
            "void vulnerable_function(char *input) { char buffer[10]; strcpy(buffer, input); // Can overwrite the return address }\n",
            "\n",
            "o Use After Free Vulnerability: Happens when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed. C provides manual memory management using malloc and free. If a pointer is used after free without setting it to NULL, it can lead to undefined behavior or security issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "char *ptr = malloc(20); free(ptr); strcpy(ptr, \"vulnerable\");\n",
            "\n",
            "o Dangling Pointer: A pointer that continues to reference a memory location after the memory it points to has been deallocated. Similar to use after free, but can also occur if a pointer is left pointing to a local variable whose stack frame has been popped.\n",
            "\n",
            "char* func() { char local_buffer[10]; return local_buffer; // Returning address of local variable }\n",
            "\n",
            "o Integer Overflow and Underflow: Occurs when arithmetic operations produce results that exceed the representable range of the data type. C does not check for integer overflows. If the result of an arithmetic operation is too large or too small, it wraps around.\n",
            "\n",

            "o Format String Vulnerability: Arise when untrusted data is used as a format string in functions like printf. C's printf and related functions do not validate format strings. An attacker can use format specifiers to read or write arbitrary memory locations.\n",
            "\n",
            "char user_input[100]; scanf(\"%s\", user_input); printf(user_input); // Vulnerable if user_input contains format specifiers\n",
            "\n",
            "o Secure and Unsecure Functions in C: In C programming, secure and unsecure functions are terms that refer to how well a function handles potentially dangerous operations, particularly regarding memory safety and data integrity. Secure functions are designed to mitigate risks such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other common issues. In contrast, unsecure functions often lack built-in protections and can expose programs to these risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "o Buffer Operations: The strcpy() function copies a string from the source to the destination buffer without checking the size of the buffer. This can lead to buffer overflows if the source string is larger than the destination buffer. On the contrary, the strncpy() function copies a specified number of characters from the source to the destination buffer, ensuring that the buffer is not overflowed. It also null-terminates the string if the length is less than the specified number.\n",
            "\n",
            "o String Formatting: The printf() and sprintf() functions are used to output formatted data, but if used with untrusted format strings, it can lead to format string vulnerabilities. On the contrary, the snprintf() function formats and stores a string in a buffer, ensuring that the buffer size is respected to prevent overflow. It also ensures null termination.\n",

It does not check the size of the buffer, leading to buffer overflows if the input is larger than the buffer. On the contrary, the fgets() function reads a specified number of characters from a file stream, including standard input, and ensures that the buffer is not overflowed. It also handles newline characters properly.\n",
            "\n",
            "o Memory Management: The malloc() and free() functions are used for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. While malloc and free themselves are not inherently insecure, improper use, such as double-freeing or accessing freed memory, can lead to vulnerabilities. To avoid this, one should use memory management techniques that avoid common pitfalls, such as ensuring pointers are set to NULL after being freed and checking for NULL returns from malloc.\n",

In the code snippet shown in the left, the to_append string is too long to fit into the buffer after the initial “Hello, ”. The line strcat(buffer, to_append), will therefore cause a buffer overflow generating a segmentation fault. In the code snippet shown in the right, the strncat() function is used, which is safer because it allows you to copy up to specify the maximum number of characters to append, which helps prevent buffer overflow by ensuring you don’t exceed the size of the destination buffer.

            "We all know that the /etc/shadow file is a critical file in Unix-like operating systems that stores user account information, specifically the hashed passwords and related security attributes for user accounts. The /etc/shadow file is usually only accessible by the root user and certain privileged processes. This is to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. From the screenshot, one can see that the permissions on this file are set to 640, meaning that the owner (root) has read and write permissions, the group (shadow) has only read permissions, and others have no access. So, a regular user cannot even view the content of this file. However, this can be done by a user who is in the sudo group, and since the user kali is a member of this group, so he/she can view its contents using the sudo command as shown in the screenshot.\n",

            "Now a 100$ question is how come every user can use the passwd command to change his/her password, that resides in this /etc/shadow file. One way is to run a privileged daemon running at all times that can do this job for regular users, but this is of course expensive. So, the solution used by all UNIX systems for such tasks is the SUID bit. The SUID (Set User ID) bit is a special file permission in Unix-like operating systems that allows users to execute a file with the permissions of the file owner rather than the permissions of the user executing the file. The advantage of SUID bit is that it allows users to perform tasks that require higher privileges without giving them full access to the system. It is denoted by an 's' in the owner's execute permission or a capital 'S' if the owner's execute permission is off. An example of a program having its SUID bit set is the /usr/bin/passwd program, that is used by regular users to change their own password by modifying the contents of /etc/shadow file owned by root.

            "Websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the Internet. This makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. In order to access services on a website, a user normally enters his/her credentials, which are sent to the server for verification. A user can be authenticated using a combination of following techniques:\n",
            "\n",
            "Something you know (password, passphrase, PIN) • Something you have (NIC, ATM, Passport) • Something you are (Biometrics) • Somewhere you are (Geographic location, IP, MAC address) • Something you do (signatures, pattern unlock) Session Management\n",

For example, once a user has been authenticated by the server, the user may like to visit other pages of the application, e.g., his/her profile page, or change password page and so on. Now all these pages are authenticated pages, so one way is that the user has to give his/her username:password every time he/she wants to visit an authenticated page and the other way is using Session ID. Session Management is a process that involves maintaining state between a user and a web application across multiple requests, as HTTP itself is a stateless protocol. Here is a breakdown of how session management is done at an abstract level:\n",

            "A brute-force attack is when an attacker uses a system of trial and error to guess valid user credentials. Brute-forcing is not always just a case of making completely random guesses at usernames and passwords. Attackers normally use publicly available knowledge to fine-tune brute- force attacks and make much more educated guesses (dictionary attacks, use of rainbow tables). These attacks are typically automated using wordlists of usernames and passwords. using dedicated tools (hydra, medusa, burpsuite) to make vast numbers of login attempts at high speed.\n",

Username enumeration typically occurs on a login page, when you enter a valid username but an incorrect password and get a specific message. It can also occur on signup/registration forms when you enter a username that is already taken. This greatly reduces the time and effort required to brute-force a login because the attacker is able to quickly generate a shortlist of valid usernames.\n",

            "Many websites rely exclusively on single-factor authentication using a password to authenticate users. However, some require users to prove their identity using multiple authentication factors. Verifying biometric factors is impractical for most websites, however, most websites use two-Factor Authentication (2FA) based on something you know and something you have. This usually requires users to enter both a traditional password and a temporary verification code from an out- of-band physical device in their possession. It is sometimes possible for an attacker to obtain a single knowledge-based factor, such as a password, but simultaneously obtaining another factor from an out-of-band source is considerably less likely. For this reason, two-factor authentication is demonstrably more secure than single-factor authentication.\n",
            "\n",
            "Poorly implemented two-factor authentication can be beaten, or even bypassed entirely, just as single-factor authentication can. For example, if the user is first prompted to enter a password, and then prompted to enter a verification code on a separate page, the user is effectively in a \"logged in\" state before they have entered the verification code. In this case, it is worth testing to see if you can directly skip to \"logged-in only\" pages after completing the first authentication step. Occasionally, you will find that a website doesn't actually check whether or not you completed the second step before loading the page.\n",

This functionality is often implemented by generating a \"remember me\" or \"Keep me logged in\" token of some kind, which is then stored in a persistent cookie. As possessing this cookie effectively allows you to bypass the entire login process, it is best practice for this cookie to be impractical to guess. However, some websites generate this cookie based on a predictable concatenation of static values, such as the username and a timestamp. Some even use the password as part of the cookie.

Command injection vulnerability enables a malicious user to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. This happens when user passes unsafe data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) and due to improper sanitization is directly passed to a system shell or command interpreter. If the input is not properly validated, these commands are executed with the privileges of the application. OS command injection vulnerabilities are usually very serious and may lead to compromise of the server hosting the application. It may also be possible to use the server as a platform for attacks against other systems.\n",

Known for its stability, improved GUI, and the introduction of features like fast user switching and enhanced security.\\n\\n§ Windows Vista (2007): Introduced a new Aero GUI with advanced graphics and visual effects. It featured improved security (User Account Control) and better networking but faced criticism for performance issues and compatibility problems.\\n\\n§ Windows 7 (2009): Improved upon Vista with better performance, a more refined interface, and enhanced features like the redesigned taskbar and libraries. It was widely praised for its stability and user experience.\\n\\n§ Windows 8 (2012): A radical redesign focusing on touch-based devices with the introduction of the Metro UI (later known as Modern UI). It featured a Start Screen instead of the traditional Start Menu and brought improvements for tablets and hybrid devices.\\n\\n§ Windows 8.1 (2013): Addressed some criticisms of Windows 8 by reintroducing the Start button and improving multitasking and personalization features.\\n\\n§ Windows 10 (2015): Marked a return to a more familiar desktop interface with the Start Menu and integrated new features like Cortana (digital assistant), Microsoft Edge (web browser), and virtual desktops. It introduced the concept of \"Windows as a Service,\" with regular updates rather than major new versions.\\n\\n§ Windows 11 (2021): Introduced a redesigned Start Menu, centered taskbar, and a more modern interface with rounded corners. It focused on improving productivity and multitasking with features like Snap Layouts and virtual desktops. It also emphasized performance, security, and support for the latest hardware.\\n\\n2. Unix-based OS: Unix is a powerful, multiuser, multitasking operating system originally developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It has influenced many modern operating systems and has several variants that have evolved over time. Here’s a detailed look at the evolution of Unix and its derivatives:',\n",

It was a basic kernel that provided rudimentary multitasking capabilities and was mainly intended to be a Unix-like operating system for personal computers. It could only run-on Intel 80386 processors and was released to a small group of users.\\n\\n• Linux 0.02 - 0.11 (1991-1992): These early versions included various improvements such as better hardware support, enhanced stability, and the addition of fundamental features like the Virtual File System (VFS).\\n\\n• Linux 1.0 (1994): The first stable release of Linux. It included improved support for hardware, networking, and system calls, establishing a more solid foundation for future development.\\n\\n• Linux 2.0 (1996): Introduced significant improvements such as support for multiple processors (symmetric multiprocessing) and enhanced network capabilities. This version helped Linux gain credibility in server environments.\\n\\n• Linux 2.2 (1999): Added support for new hardware architectures, better performance, and introduced the concept of kernel modules, which allowed for dynamic loading and unloading of drivers.\\n\\n• Linux 2.4 (2001): Focused on performance and scalability improvements. It introduced support for USB, improved memory management, and support for larger file systems and more hardware platforms.\\n\\n• Linux 2.6 (2003): Brought major improvements such as better support for multi-core processors, improved security features, and more advanced file systems (e.g., ext3). This version laid the groundwork for Linux's widespread adoption in servers and enterprise environments.\\n\\n• Linux 3.x (2011): Marked a new major series with a focus on performance improvements, better power management, and support for new hardware. It also included features like improved virtualization support and enhanced file systems.\\n\\n• Linux 4.x (2015): Introduced more incremental improvements, including better hardware support, enhanced security features, and more efficient file systems. This series continued to refine the kernel and support a wide range of hardware.\\n\\n• Linux 5.x (2019): Added support for new hardware, enhanced security features, and improvements in performance and scalability. Key features included support for new filesystems like Btrfs and ext4 improvements, better support for ARM architecture, and various performance optimizations.\\n\\n• Linux 6.x (2022-): The current series includes ongoing updates and enhancements to performance, hardware support, and security.

It was still dependent on MS-DOS.\\n\\n§ Windows 3.0 (1990): Marked a significant improvement with a more advanced GUI, virtual memory, and improved performance. It introduced the Program Manager and File Manager.\\n\\n§ Windows 3.1 (1992): Introduced TrueType fonts for better typography and improved multimedia support. It was also the first version to gain significant popularity.\\n\\n§ Windows 95 (1995): A major milestone with a new GUI, Start Menu, taskbar, and Plug and Play hardware support. It integrated MS-DOS and Windows into a single operating system.\\n\\n§ Windows 98 (1998): Built on Windows 95 with improved hardware support, Internet Explorer integration, and better system performance. It also introduced the Windows Update feature.\\n\\n§ Windows ME (Millennium Edition) (2000): Focused on multimedia and home networking. It was criticized for its stability issues but introduced System Restore and improved Internet support.\\n\\n2\\n\\nInstructor(s): Muhammad Rauf Butt, Muhammad Arif Butt, PhD\\n\\n§ Windows XP (2001): A highly successful version combining the consumer-oriented Windows 95/98/ME and the business-oriented Windows NT line. Known for its stability, improved GUI, and the introduction of features like fast user switching and enhanced security.\\n\\n§ Windows Vista (2007): Introduced a new Aero GUI with advanced graphics and visual effects. It featured improved security (User Account Control) and better networking but faced criticism for performance issues and compatibility problems.\\n\\n§ Windows 7 (2009): Improved upon Vista with better performance, a more refined interface, and enhanced features like the redesigned taskbar and libraries. It was widely praised for its stability and user experience.\\n\\n§ Windows 8 (2012): A radical redesign focusing on touch-based devices with the introduction of the Metro UI (later known as Modern UI). It featured a Start Screen instead of the traditional Start Menu and brought improvements for tablets and hybrid devices.\\n\\n§ Windows 8.1 (2013): Addressed some criticisms of Windows 8 by reintroducing the Start button and improving multitasking and personalization features.\\n\\n§ Windows 10 (2015): Marked a return to a more familiar desktop interface with the Start Menu and integrated new features like Cortana (digital assistant), Microsoft Edge (web browser), and virtual desktops. It introduced the concept of \"Windows as a Service,\" with regular updates rather than major new versions.\\n\\n§ Windows 11 (2021): Introduced a redesigned Start Menu, centered taskbar, and a more modern interface with rounded corners. It focused on improving productivity and multitasking with features like Snap Layouts and virtual desktops. It also emphasized performance, security, and support for the latest hardware.\\n\\n2. Unix-based OS: Unix is a powerful, multiuser, multitasking operating system originally developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It has influenced many modern operating systems and has several variants that have evolved over time. Here’s a detailed look at the evolution of Unix and its derivatives:',\n",
              " \"• Unix Version 1 (1969): Developed by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others at AT&T's Bell Labs. It was initially created on a PDP-7 and used a simple, monolithic kernel with a command-line interface. It laid the groundwork for many Unix concepts.\\n\\n• Unix Version 6 (1975): One of the most influential early versions, it introduced features such as pipes, which allowed the output of one program to be used as the input for another. It was widely distributed and had a significant impact on the spread of Unix.\\n\\n• Unix Version 7 (1979): Also known as Unix V7, it included significant improvements, such as the Bourne shell (sh) and the C programming language (which was used to write the kernel and utilities). This version was highly influential and became the basis for many later Unix variants.\\n\\n3\\n\\nInstructor(s): Muhammad Rauf Butt, Muhammad Arif Butt, PhD\\n\\n• System III UNIX (1982): AT&T's Unix System III was an attempt to unify and standardize the various Unix versions. It introduced new features and served as a foundation for future commercial Unix versions.\\n\\n• System V UNIX (1983): This version, often referred to as Unix System V, introduced several key features, including the System V Interface Definition (SVID), a standardized interface for Unix system calls and utilities. It also introduced important enhancements like the SysV init system, shared libraries, and the STREAMS networking interface.\\n\\n• BSD UNIX (Berkeley Software Distribution): An influential series of Unix versions developed at the University of California, Berkeley. BSD Unix introduced many innovations such as the TCP/IP stack, the vi editor, and the BSD license. o Versions:\\n\\n1. BSD 4.2 (1983): Introduced important features like the TCP/IP networking stack.\\n\\n2. BSD 4.4 (1994): Known for its extensive features, including advanced networking, filesystem improvements, and tools.\\n\\n• AIX (1986): IBM’s Unix variant, originally based on System V. AIX introduced features tailored for IBM hardware and has been used in various IBM servers and workstations.\\n\\n• HP-UX (1984): Hewlett-Packard’s Unix variant, based on System V, but with additional features specific to HP’s hardware and software environments.\\n\\n• Solaris (1992): Sun Microsystems’ Unix variant, initially based on System V and later incorporating elements from BSD. Solaris introduced features such as the ZFS filesystem and DTrace for dynamic tracing.\\n\\n• Linux (1991-): Although not a direct derivative of Unix, Linux is a Unix-like operating system created by Linus Torvalds. It is influenced by Unix principles and has become a major operating system for servers, desktops, and embedded systems.\\n\\n• macOS (2001-): Apple’s operating system for Macintosh computers, based on a Unix foundation. It incorporates elements from the NeXTSTEP operating system and provides a Unix-based environment with a user-friendly graphical interface.\\n\\n• FreeBSD (1993-): A direct descendant of BSD Unix, FreeBSD is known for its advanced networking features, performance, and security. It is widely used in servers and networking environments.\\n\\n• OpenBSD (1996-): A Unix-like OS focused on security and code correctness. It originated from the BSD lineage and is known for its emphasis on security features and code auditing.\\n\\n4\\n\\nInstructor(s): Muhammad Rauf Butt, Muhammad Arif Butt, PhD\\n\\n• NetBSD (1993-): Another BSD-derived operating system, NetBSD is known for its portability across a wide range of hardware platforms.\\n\\nan Linux’\\n\\n3. Linux: Description: An open-source OS with many distributions (distros) available. Known for its flexibility, security, and use in servers and development environments. The evolution of Linux is a story of growth from a hobbyist project to a major force in both server and desktop environments. Here’s a detailed look at the major milestones in the history evolution of Linux Kernel:\"]"
