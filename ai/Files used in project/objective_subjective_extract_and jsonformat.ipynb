And as the risk is involved, we will also use **Spiral model** in the start.\\n\\n#### Reasons:\\nThe reason to select RAD process model is the time limit as well as other factors. Each department is working independently already. We just need to combine them under one system which means that we already have components and these components will be pieced together to make one system. The **Component-based development** is the specialty of RAD model. Due to risk factor, we will be using **Spiral model** to eliminate it.\",\n",

It is decided by the higher management that all the departments should be integrated under one system where they must work independently. Higher Management wants to see this system within this year.

Risk is also involved in this.\\n\\n#### Assumptions:\\nAs the system is for university and it includes all the departments, we can combine them under one system so they can function independently.\\n\\n#### Selected Process Models:\\nThe selected process model will be **Incremental RAD model**. And as the risk is involved, we will also use **Spiral model** in the start.\\n\\n#### Reasons:\\nThe reason to select RAD process model is the time limit as well as other factors. Each department is working independently already. We just need to combine them under one system which means that we already have components and these components will be pieced together to make one system. The **Component-based development** is the specialty of RAD model. Due to risk factor, we will be using **Spiral model** to eliminate it.\",\n",
